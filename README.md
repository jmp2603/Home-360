Oceanaut: Mobile APP

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## Getting Started

First, run the app:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

Youâ€™ll need to enable debugging options on your phone to run this apk.

Debug APK
step:1 Go to the root of the project in the terminal
step:2 Go to android directory
cd android
step:3 Now in this android folder, run this command
./gradlew assembleDebug

There! youâ€™ll find the apk file in the following path:
yourProject/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

Release APK
step:1 Go to the root of the project in the terminal
step:2 Go to android directory
cd android
step:3 Now in this android folder, run this command
For Windows,
gradlew assembleRelease
For Linux and Mac OS,
./gradlew assembleRelease

There! youâ€™ll find the apk file in the following path:
yourProject/android/app/build/outputs/apk/app-release.apk

## Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
